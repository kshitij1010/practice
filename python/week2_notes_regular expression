-->To use regualr expression in your program , mention below commnad
	import re

--> to open file:
	open("file_name")
	example. xyz=open("hello.txt")

Example to find word in file
(Normal way_____):
Ex-1._________________________________
xyz=open("file_name")
for line in xyz:
	line = line.rstrip() #remove last or trailing character
	if line.find("From:") >= 0: 
	#if string is not there, then it will return "-1" as a value. that is why this condition has been used
		print line

(using Regular expression_____):

import re

xyz=open("file_name")
for line in xyz:
	line=line.rstrip()	#remove last or trailing character
	if re.search("From:", line):
		print line
________________________________________
to find line starting with provided word
Ex-2.
xyz=open("file_name")
for line in xyz:
	line = line.rstrip() #remove last or trailing character
	if line.startswith("From:") >= 0: 
	#if string is not there, then it will return "-1" as a value. that is why this condition has been used
		print line

(using Regular expression_____):

import re

xyz=open("file_name")
for line in xyz:
	line=line.rstrip()	#remove last or trailing character
	if re.search("^From:", line):############
	# "^" sign implies that serach just for the starting word 'from'
		print line
______________________________________

---->
^   match the start of the line
.   match any character
*   any number of times (0 or more times)
+   any number of times (1 or more times)
\S  match any non-whitespace character

#########in the ex-2., if we write if re.search("^x.*:",line)
Out put would be line starting with "x" and has or has not ":" in the text (space/no space in between "x" and ":")
ex. "x-now its time for programming: python"
    "x is the lead character:unsolved"
    "xheyhello how are u?"
    "xheyhello:how are u?"
    "x-heyhello:howareu?"
#########in the ex-2., if we write if re.search("^x\S+:",line)
Out put would be line starting with "x" and has ":" atleast one time or more time in the text. no whitespace allowed as \S is mentioned (no space in between "x" and ":")
ex.
    "xheyhello:how are u?"
    "x-heyhello:howareu?"

---->re.search("word_to_serach")
this command will return true or false, depends upon word is there in text or not
	a="hey hello bittu how are you"
	b=re.search("bittu",a)
	if b>=0:
		print "correct"
	else:
		print "not in text"
	####output:: correct

	c=re.search("askbdkas",a)
	if c>=0:
		print "correct"
	else:
		print "not in text"
	####output:: not in text

---->re.findall
this command will look in text or string and find word happed to multiple time in string or text
"findall" will provide python list as an output

	a="my 2 favorite numbers are 72 and 100"
	b=re.findall('[0-6]+',a)
	c=re.findall('[0-9]+',a)
	d=re.findall('2',a)
	e=re.findall('[0-9]',a)
	f=re.findall('my+',a)
	print b,c,d,e
	####ouput::['2', '2', '100'] ['2', '72', '100'] ['2', '2'] ['2', '7', '2', '1', '0', '0'] ['my', 'my']

to find from the list of character
	abc=re.findall('[ayx]',a)
	print abc
	####output::['a', 'a', 'a']
	#there is no x and y so it is just showing found "a" in list format

----> greedy match and non greedy match (check ppt of regular expression
----> "?" add to the "+" or "*" to indicate that the match is to be done in a non-greedy manne

----> To find "e-mail" from single line text
x=From xyz.abc@hello.com sat June 5 09:12:16 2008
y=re.findall("\S+@\S",x) #\non-wihite space character
print y
##### output:: ['xyz.abc@hello.com']

Example of combination regular expression using parenthesis
	y=re.findall("^From (\S+@\S)",x)
	##this will return as above only, but only from line which is starting with "From".

---->xyz=re.findall("@([^ ]*)",x)
this regex means find "@" in text and after that match word until it finds blank space
x=From xyz.abc@hello.com sat June 5 09:12:16 2008
xyz=re.findall("@([^ ]*)",x)
print xyz
####output:: hello.com
