What are some common ways to get O(n) runtime?

One common way to get O(n) runtime is to use a greedy algorithm.
Example, in case we're looking to just grab a specific value from our input set
(e.g. the "largest" or the "greatest difference")

Another common way to get O(n) runtime is to use counting.
Example,
We can build a list score_counts where the indices represent scores
and the values represent how many times the score appears.
Once we have that, can we generate a sorted list of scores?
