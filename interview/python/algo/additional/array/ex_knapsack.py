# Knapsack Problem | DP
#
# Given weights and values of n items,
# put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.
# In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1]
# which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
# Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
# find out the maximum value subset of val[]
# such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
# You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
